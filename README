===================
NOTE FOR 2.6 KERNEL
===================

Test environment: OpenSUSE 11.2 (gcc 4.4 kernel 2.6.31)
		  Ubuntu 11.04 (gcc 4.5.2 kernel 2.6.38)

This example use the heap area to run its Image, Linux kernel's 
support for the NX bit must be disabled before the program
can run.

Since NX bit resides in PAE part of the page table, recompiling
the linux kernel without CONFIG_X86_PAE or boot the kernel with
the parameter "noexec=off" both serves the purpose of disabling
NX bit.

To run under Ubuntu 11.04, you will also have to:

1) disable randomization of process virtual address space
2) disable vdso (virtual dynamic shared object)
3) allow memory allocated from low address space

$ sudo sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space=0
$ sudo sysctl vm.vdso_enabled=0
$ sudo sysctl vm.mmap_min_addr=0

--------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a list of changes from the original embed_example.zip
for running it in OpenSUSE 11.2

1. The first 64k (0x0-0xFFFF) virtual address seems illegal for 
   user application. preboot .text & .data now starts from
   0x10000 and 0x12000 respectively. 

2. gcc 4.4 generates a .eh_frame (call frames unwinding at 
   exception handling) section for the C code it compiles when 
   -g option is specified. But we don't need it. The removal of
   the .eh_frame section can be done at compiled time with
   -fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm gcc option, at linked time by linker 
   (controlled by linker script) or by objcopy. 

3. -ffreestanding option is used to disable gcc from using 
   builtin function for certain system calls.

  - noexec_setup(), __supported_pte_mask for _PAGE_NX bit
    filtering

  - __P011, PAGE_COPY page table bit definition

  - protection_map[], vm_getpage_prot() rwx->pgprot mapping 
* arch/x86/mm/fault.c
  - do_page_fault() page fault type classify. if page fault is 
    legal, eventually call handle_mm_fault()
* mm/memory.c
  - handle_mm_fault(), handle_pte_fault(), do_anonymous_page()
  - do_anonymous_page() allocates a new page, make the pte 
    point to the new page with pgprot = vma->vm_page_prot
