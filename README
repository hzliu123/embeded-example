============================
NOTE FOR KERNEL 2.6 or later
============================

Tested environment: Ubuntu 16.04 (gcc 5.3.1 kernel 4.4.0)

This example use the heap area to run its Image, Linux kernel's 
support for the NX bit must be disabled before the program
can run.

Since NX bit resides in PAE part of the page table, recompiling
the linux kernel without CONFIG_X86_PAE or boot the kernel with
the parameter "noexec=off" both serve the purpose of disabling
NX bit.

You also need to:

1) disable randomization of process virtual address space

$ sudo sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space=0


You may need these if your environment is not Ubuntu 16.04:

2) disable vdso (virtual dynamic shared object)

$ sudo sysctl abi.vsyscall32=0

3) allow memory allocated from low address space

$ sudo sysctl vm.mmap_min_addr=65536

---------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a list of changes to the original embed_example.zip,
which was developed for kernel 2.4, for running it on kernel 
2.6 or later.

1. The first 64k (0x0-0xFFFF) virtual address isn't usable for 
   user application. preboot .text & .data now starts from
   0x10000 and 0x12000 respectively. 

2. gcc 4.4 generates a .eh_frame (call frames unwinding at 
   exception handling) section for the C code it compiles when 
   -g option is specified. But we don't need it. The removal of
   the .eh_frame section can be done at compiled time with
   -fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm gcc option, at linked time by linker 
   (controlled by linker script) or by objcopy. 

3. -ffreestanding option is used to disable gcc from using 
   builtin function for certain system calls.

  - noexec_setup(), __supported_pte_mask for _PAGE_NX bit
    filtering

    legal, eventually call handle_mm_fault()
* mm/memory.c
  - handle_mm_fault(), handle_pte_fault(), do_anonymous_page()
  - do_anonymous_page() allocates a new page, make the pte 
    point to the new page with pgprot = vma->vm_page_prot
